recipe1 = Recipe.create(title: 'Banana Coconut French Toast', prep_time: 10, cook_time: 20, servings: 4, meal: 'breakfast', 
ingredients: "1 lb loaf crusty French bread, cut into Â¾ slices, 1 very ripe banana, 1 (14 oz) can coconut milk, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/2 teaspoon salt, coconut oil",
instructions: "1. In a container large enough to accommodate a slice or two of bread, mash the banana until it's smooth. Add the coconut milk, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and salt and whisk to combine. You want this batter to be as smooth as possible. 
2. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat.
3. Dip a slice of bread into the batter and let it soak for a few seconds on each side. Let the excess drip off and then fry it in the skillet until golden and crispy on each side, about 3 minutes per side.
4. Repeat with the rest of the bread, adding coconut oil to the skillet as needed.
5. Serve with syrup, fresh blueberries, and shredded coconut. Enjoy!",
