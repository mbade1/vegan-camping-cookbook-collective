MONDAY:

    - Models, get API working correctly.







Building the rest of your application
Okay, so if you've gotten this far, you have a Rails app running and you have a vanilla HTML and JavaScript client app that can talk to the Rails app. You'll want to add features to your project, to match your design. Where to next?

Some things to consider:

To add nouns to your world, create models in rails

To show your nouns, you'll need:

A controller action to send the data
A fetch request to ask for the data
Some JavaScript code to handle DOM-rendering
To make your page respond to the user, you'll need event listeners

To keep your code clean, you should use JavaScript classes

To organize your code, you can use multiple JavaScript files (don't forget to add <script> tags for each one!)
