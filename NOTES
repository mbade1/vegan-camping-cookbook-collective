MONDAY:

    - Models, get API working correctly.



Layer Order: migrations, models, seed data, controller actions, data fetching, view logic, styling

Build the R from CRUD for just one model, vertically! 
That means one migration, one model, one controller action, one fetch call, and one DOM update. 
Add seed data and confirm that your code works by testing it visually.
Then, build the next CRUD action (maybe Create or Update), again building vertically.
Continue building features one by one, (vertically!)
Add feature by feature, not model by model or layer by layer.
Test each feature, add styles, and create seed data as you go (not all at once at the end)



Building the rest of your application
Okay, so if you've gotten this far, you have a Rails app running and you have a vanilla HTML and JavaScript client app that can talk to the Rails app. You'll want to add features to your project, to match your design. Where to next?

Some things to consider:

To add nouns to your world, create models in rails

To show your nouns, you'll need:

A controller action to send the data
A fetch request to ask for the data
Some JavaScript code to handle DOM-rendering
To make your page respond to the user, you'll need event listeners

To keep your code clean, you should use JavaScript classes

To organize your code, you can use multiple JavaScript files (don't forget to add <script> tags for each one!)
